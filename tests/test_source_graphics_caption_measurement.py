"""The caption-on-face measurement must measure OUR captions, not source text.

Defect evidence (run 37329847616, 2026-10-05)
---------------------------------------------
``clip_3_STOP_MAKING_EXCUSES_NOW.mp4`` (Dave Ramsey episode) measured **16% of
"caption" pixels on the brow/eyes, worst at 0%**, blocked, re-rendered with the
time-ranged face-safe bands, and measured the same 16% again. Dissection of the
artifact showed every one of our caption pixels sitting safely at the bottom of
the frame (``y[264-269]`` at 360p) while all the overlap came from the show's
own burned-in graphics -- the giant "THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW" logo and the
"STOP MAKING EXCUSES NOW" banner during the first ~4 seconds -- which
``outlined_text_mask`` cannot distinguish from captions.

The fix: only *persistent* text rows count as captions. Our captions are on
screen in nearly every frame; a programme's own graphics are transient.

"""P1 Jump-Cut Engine: dead-air removal from word timestamps.

Firecrawl research (2026-10-05): removing dead air and filler pauses is the
industry-standard "feels edited" upgrade (TimeBolt, SavvyCut, Jump Cutter
ULTRA all sell exactly this), and 50-60% of short-form viewers drop off in the
first three seconds (KometMedia pacing guide), so pacing is retention. Clips
that keep every natural pause read as "raw excerpt", not "edited".

This module is the pure engine: it turns word timestamps into a keep-segment
list and a compacted timeline (old clip time -> new timeline). The renderer
consumes the plan; the caption layer remaps word times through it. No media
access, so every rule is unit-tested with constructed word lists.

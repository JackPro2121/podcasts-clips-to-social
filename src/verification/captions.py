"""Caption placement, measured against the pixels the pipeline actually burned in.

The defect
----------
Captions render across the subject's face. Measured on
``clip_1_THE_REAL_FEAR_OF_GOING_BROKE.mp4`` at t=1.2s, 14.0s and 31.0s, the
caption baseline sits at y ~ 490 of 1920 -- **25.5% of frame height, directly over
the eyebrows and eyes** -- while ``SAFE_ZONE_TOP`` is 240px (12.5%), so the text
is twice as deep into the frame as the safe zone allows. On the split-screen
segment the caption lands at y ~ 960, exactly on the pane divider.

Why the existing check missed it: ``editorial_qa`` compares ``shot.caption_rect``
against ``shot.protected_regions``, and **both are written by the same code**
minutes apart. It never samples a frame. It therefore confirms the plan, not the
video.

The fix in this module
----------------------
Render the real ASS through libass onto a black canvas and read back where the
glyphs actually land. That is the only formulation that can catch "the caption is
on the face", because it does not care what any plan claimed.

Reuse in the mirror detector
----------------------------
:func:`text_mask` is also what makes :mod:`src.verification.mirror` work.

The mirror detector's first CI run returned a **false negative** on the clip that
is demonstrably mirrored. The reason is structural and worth recording: OCR found
11 text boxes at 0.98 confidence in the original orientation and 10 at 0.88 in the
mirrored one, and concluded "correct". But 10 of those 11 boxes are the pipeline's
*own burned-in captions*, which libass renders after the frame is assembled and
which are therefore always correctly oriented no matter what the source was. One
genuinely mirrored element -- the "SHURE SM7B" microphone label -- cannot outvote
ten correct ones.

So mirror detection must exclude the pipeline's own text before comparing
orientations. That requires knowing where the pipeline drew, which is exactly what
this module computes. The two modules are coupled by design.

# --- pixel-based caption detection (no ASS available) -----------------------
#
# The exact path above needs the ASS file, which is in scope during a run but is
# not retained for clips that were already published. The golden-master corpus is
# exactly that case, so this fallback measures the captions that are actually in
# the pixels.
#
# It keys on the colour signature every subtitle theme shares. Measured themes:
# hormozi #FFE600, neon_green #22FF33, luxury_gold #FFD700, cyber_cyan #00FFFF, and
# white body text. All of them are high-value and highly saturated, and libass
# draws a black outline around them, so a caption pixel is *bright and saturated*
# and its neighbour is *near black*.
#
# The outline requirement is what keeps this from firing on the source. A
# presenter wearing a red shirt is bright and saturated but is not surrounded by
# black, so it is excluded. That is a heuristic and it is reported as one: the
# caller gets ``confidence="heuristic"`` and is expected to treat the result as
# advisory rather than as a gate.

# The outline requirement is what keeps this from firing on the source, and the
# thresholds are tight for the same reason. A first attempt used
# ``value>=150, saturation>=90, dark<=70`` and the resulting "caption band" was
# the entire frame on all six golden masters: real footage has plenty of bright
# saturated pixels with a dark neighbour somewhere in a 3x3 window.
#
# The measured values below localise correctly. On
# ``clip_1_THE_REAL_FEAR_OF_GOING_BROKE.mp4`` they put the band at y 25.0-50.4% of
# frame height, which matches the 25.5% caption baseline measured by eye from a
# full-resolution frame. On ``clip_2_WHY_DISNEY_PAY_IS_A_TRAP.mp4`` they put it at
# 49.2-74.8%, matching that clip's mid-frame caption.
#
# They are this tight because the theme colours are extreme: #FFE600 has value
# 255 and saturation 230, so a wide margin buys nothing but false positives.

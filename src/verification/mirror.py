"""Selfie-flip (mirrored) source detection.

A published clip in the corpus is horizontally flipped: the "SHURE SM7B"
microphone label reads right-to-left, and the subject and background are
consistently mirrored. There is no flip filter anywhere in the renderer, so the
flip is inherited from the source, and nothing in the pipeline noticed. Editorial
QA passed the clip.

**A single frame cannot tell you whether it is mirrored.** There is no universal
"correct" orientation for arbitrary footage, so any absolute heuristic --
bilateral symmetry, face-shape priors, lighting direction -- will fire on
legitimate content. The one thing that *does* carry the information is text,
because text has a canonical reading direction.

So this detector is **self-normalising**: it runs OCR on the frame and on the
horizontally flipped frame, and compares.

* Correctly oriented text is recognised in the original and not in the mirror.
* Mirrored text is the reverse.

Whichever orientation OCR reads better is the correct one. There is no absolute
threshold to tune and no content that can produce a false positive, because the
comparison is against the same content in both orientations.

Honest limits, established by measurement rather than assumption
----------------------------------------------------------------
CI run 1, without caption exclusion, on the six golden masters: the detector
returned a **false negative** on a clip that is demonstrably mirrored. It found 11
OCR boxes at 0.98 confidence in the original orientation against 10 at 0.88 in the
mirrored one, and concluded "correct".

The cause is structural. Ten of those eleven boxes are the pipeline's own
burned-in captions, which libass renders after the frame is assembled and which
are therefore correctly oriented no matter what the source was. One genuinely
mirrored element cannot outvote ten correct ones.

CI run 2, with the caption band excluded: **every clip now reports "no readable
text in either orientation"**, including the mirrored one. Excluding the captions
left nothing, because the captions were the only text RapidOCR could read. The
"SHURE SM7B" microphone label is small, curved and low-contrast, and RapidOCR does
not return a box for it.

So the conclusion is not "the detector is broken". It is this:

    **For podcast footage, the burned-in captions are the only reliably
    machine-readable text, and they carry no information about source
    orientation. Pixel-level mirror detection on rendered output is therefore not
    viable for this content type.**

That is a fundamental limit, not a tuning problem. There is no way to detect
mirroring from pixels alone unless the content is orientation-dependent, and text
is the only such content; if the text cannot be read, the question is
unanswerable.

The viable place to check is therefore **the source**, before the render:

* the renderer contains no flip filter (verified: no ``hflip``/``vflip``/
  ``transpose`` anywhere in the pipeline), so ``mirrored(output) ==
  mirrored(source)`` exactly;
* the source has the channel's own text, not our captions, so there is nothing to
  exclude;
* it is one check per download rather than per render.

:func:`analyse` therefore takes an optional ``source_path``: pass it when the
source segment is available and the measurement is exact, and omit it for
historical artifacts, where the honest answer is "not determinable".

Requirements:

* **Needs OCR.** Without RapidOCR the answer is "not measurable". It is not
  guessed from symmetry or face-shape priors, because a guessed answer here is
  worse than none.
* **Reuses** :mod:`src.text_detection` rather than calling RapidOCR directly.
  That module already contains the fix for HANDOFF section 4 bug 12, where the
  OCR response was parsed as ``(box, text, confidence)`` but ``entry[1]`` -- the
  recognised *text* -- was read as the confidence. ``float("MOST PEOPLE")``
  raised, the handler swallowed it, and the detector silently produced zero
  regions while appearing to work.

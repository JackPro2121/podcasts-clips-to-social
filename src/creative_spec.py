"""The creative contract, in code, in one place.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The project had **four different duration bounds in simultaneous circulation**:

* ``AGENTS.md`` section 2.C: 30-50s, maximum 55s
* the Gemini prompt in ``viral_detector``: "30 to 60 seconds (maximum 65)"
* the JSON schema handed to the model: 30-140s
* ``config.MAX_CLIP_DURATION`` and ``edit_director.validate_edit_plan``: 30-140s

and three different hook-badge durations, two different caption-outline widths,
and two different neon-green hex values between two documents. A published clip
came out **102 seconds long** and the run printed
``ALL CLIPS PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY!``.

None of that was a bug in any one place. It was the consequence of the contract
living in prose, with each consumer restating what it remembered.

So the numbers live here, are imported by the renderer, the subtitle generator, the
QA layer, the LLM prompt and the tests, and the documentation is checked against
this file in CI. Adding a fifth version of anything is now a build failure rather
than a silent divergence.

Motion policy and AGENTS.md 3.1
-------------------------------
``AGENTS.md`` 3.1 says "Zero Screen Shaking: static framing is rock-solid. No
vertical or horizontal bobbing waves on portrait shots." The motion guarantee
exists because ``freezedetect`` treats a static segment as a defect, and
``freeze_interval`` is unrepairable, so a static branch aborts the entire run.

Those two requirements are mutually exclusive, and the code has to pick one. It
picks the freeze gate, because a frozen frame is unambiguously broken while a slow
drift is not. ``MOTION_POLICY`` below records that decision, the amplitude it
settled on, and why.

The honest summary: **3.1 as written is not satisfiable together with the QA gate,
and the gate is the more important of the two.** The clause should be amended to
something like "no perceptible camera movement; drift is limited to
``MOTION_POLICY.MAX_PEAK_TO_PEAK_PCT`` of frame width and exists solely to keep the
frame from being static" rather than left to contradict the implementation.

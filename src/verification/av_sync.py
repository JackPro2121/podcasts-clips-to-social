"""A/V sync measurement.

There is no A/V sync check anywhere in this codebase today, and AGENTS.md section
3.2 claims "0ms Lipsync Drift ... Video frames and audio decodes are bit-identical".
Neither half of that claim is verifiable with what is in the repo, and one half is
demonstrably false:

* Video trims are quantised to ``:.2f`` (10 ms) while audio trims use ``:.3f``
  (1 ms), so the two can be up to 9 ms apart before anything else happens.
* ``aresample=48000:async=1`` deliberately stretches or squeezes audio to hit the
  video clock. That is the opposite of bit-identical.
* Worst of all, ``video_editor.py`` runs a **second** ``loudnorm`` pass with
  ``-c:v copy`` and no ``aresample``/``asetpts``/``atrim``. The video is
  stream-copied while the audio is re-filtered, and ``loudnorm`` in dynamic mode
  buffers internally. Any PTS shift it introduces slides audio against picture
  silently and permanently.

None of that was caught, because nothing looked.

Method
------
Two independent checks, because neither alone is sufficient.

**1. Structural drift (the one that works, and it is deterministic).**
Compares what the two muxed streams say about themselves: their start times and
their durations. This catches the defects actually present in this codebase:

* the second ``loudnorm`` pass with ``-c:v copy`` (``video_editor.py:116-123``)
  re-filters audio while stream-copying video, so any PTS shift it introduces
  shows up as the two streams disagreeing about duration or start;
* ``aresample=48000:async=1`` deliberately time-stretches audio;
* the 10 ms vs 1 ms trim quantisation mismatch.

It is exact, cheap, and cannot produce a false positive from content.

**Measured on the six golden masters, this found a defect the audit missed:**

``clip_3_WHY_HARD_WORK``     31.03 s             31.00 s   -33 ms
``clip_1_HOW_I_MADE_400K``   43.70 s             43.90 s   **+200 ms**
``clip_2_WHY_DISNEY_PAY``    50.33 s             50.45 s   **+117 ms**
``clip_1_PAID_OFF_60000``   102.13 s            102.14 s   (clean)
===========================  ==================  ==================

**Four of six published clips have the audio and video streams disagreeing about
their own duration by 34-200 ms.** Start times agree exactly (0.0 ms) in every
case, so the drift accumulates over the clip rather than being introduced at the
head -- which is the signature of a resampling or re-encode stage, not of a
seeking bug. AGENTS.md section 3.2 claims "0ms Lipsync Drift"; on this evidence
that is false by up to 200 ms.

**2. Onset correlation (opt-in, and it does not currently work).**
Speech onset lines up with visual motion, so the intent was to build an audio
onset envelope (half-wave rectified log-energy flux) and a baseline-subtracted
video motion envelope, then cross-correlate them.

**Measured result: peak confidence 0.045-0.100 across all six golden masters,
against a 0.15 trust threshold. It produced no usable number on any clip in the
corpus.** Halving the feature choice from RMS to onset flux roughly doubled the
confidence but did not make it actionable. The envelopes are simply not strongly
coupled in a talking-head clip: there is a lot of small continuous motion and a
lot of continuous speech, and their fine structure is not phase-locked.

It is kept, defaulted **off**, as a diagnostic for clips where the structural
check passes but a human still perceives lip-sync error. It is not presented as a
gate, because a check that reports "cannot measure" on every input is not a
check. Anyone enabling it should treat a low confidence as "no result", not as
"no problem".

    ``atrim``. This measures it directly, so the verdict can block on it without
    trusting any plan.

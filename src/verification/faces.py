"""Face boxes on the **rendered** output, for caption-placement checking.

Why
---
Captions render across the subject's face. Measured on
``clip_1_THE_REAL_FEAR_OF_GOING_BROKE.mp4`` at t=1.2s, 14.0s and 31.0s, the
caption baseline sits at y ~ 490 of 1920 -- 25.5% of frame height, directly over
the eyebrows and eyes -- while ``SAFE_ZONE_TOP`` is 240px (12.5%).

``editorial_qa`` does not catch this because it compares ``shot.caption_rect``
against ``shot.protected_regions``, and both are written by the same code
minutes apart. It never opens a frame.

The collision-avoidance relocation in ``composition_planner`` moves captions
*up* when it detects text at the bottom, and that relocation is what put the
caption on the face. ``upper_center`` resolves to roughly 25% of frame height,
which clears the platform UI band and lands squarely on the eyes. So the check
that would have caught this needs to know where the faces are **in the output**,
after the crop, not where they were in the source.

Method
------
Reuses the tracked YuNet ONNX model that ``face_tracker`` already depends on
(``src/models/face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx``, 232 KB, committed to the repo),
so this adds no dependency. Detection runs on decoded frames at the analysis
resolution, and boxes are returned in that same resolution, which is the
coordinate space :mod:`src.verification.captions` expects.

Degrades to "no faces" rather than raising. A missing model or a decode failure
produces an empty list and a reason, and the caller decides whether that blocks.

    module opened the model path directly and reported "not present" on CI,
    because the file tracked in git is named ``face_detection_yunen_2023mar.onnx``
    (note the transposed letters) while the loader looks for
    ``face_detection_yunet.onnx`` and fetches it at runtime. The caption check
    therefore silently did nothing in CI while reporting nothing wrong.

    That is precisely the failure this whole package exists to prevent -- a gate
    that cannot run and does not say so -- so the fix is twofold: reuse the loader,
    and make an unrunnable check report a warning rather than passing quietly.

"""
Text-region detection, in tiers.

`caption_source_collision` is a *blocking* QA code, but until now nothing ever
populated real `protected_regions`. `source_index` used a Sobel edge heuristic
that fires on slides and on any high-contrast graphic, and misses real text on
a busy background. The check was structurally blind: it could not fail, so it
could not protect anything.

Tiers, best first:

1. **OCR** (RapidOCR / PP-OCR ONNX). Reads real glyphs and reports per-glyph
   confidence. The dependency cannot be installed or verified on the machine
   this was built on, so it is optional and degrades cleanly to the next tier.
2. **Edge** (the original Sobel heuristic). Always available. Crude, but it is
   already in production, it is deterministic, and it needs no tuning.

**A zero-dependency MSER tier was implemented, measured, and removed.** Recorded
here because the negative result is worth not repeating:

- MSER returns *zero* regions on unblurred rendered text -- antialiased glyph
  edges are not stable enough to be extremal at multiple thresholds. A Gaussian
  sigma of 3 fixes that, restoring ~100 regions/frame.
- Those ~100 regions cover only ~20-26 per text line where the line has ~35
  characters. MSER **silently misses glyphs**, so the surviving fragments sit
  34-132 px apart. Merging them into lines needs a gap threshold wider than an
  entire text block, which merges unrelated regions. Measured: a rendered line
  of "Most people misunderstand this completely" came back as 2-3 fragments at
  any threshold, and one of the three lines was lost entirely.
- On a soft lower-third over a busy background it returned **0 regions** -- the
  exact case the edge heuristic already handles.
- Loosening the stability parameters (`max_variation` 0.6, `min_diversity` 0.05)
  does yield more regions, ~1072/frame, which floods the protected-region list
  and makes the collision check fire on everything. Worse than detecting nothing.

Also note the OpenCV Python bindings are inconsistent here: the method is
`detectRegions` (camelCase) while the constructor takes `min_area` /
`max_variation` (snake_case), and neither appears in the type stubs, so a wrong
guess fails only at runtime rather than at type-check time.

Every tier returns normalised boxes with a `source` label so a report can say
which one produced a region.

"""Motion metrics: frozen output, dead output, and the accounting QA got wrong.

The defect this module is built around is measured, not hypothetical. In the
published clip ``clip_1_HOW_I_MADE_400000_IN_A_MONTH.mp4`` freezedetect reports
three events -- 41.1s (0.533s), 41.633s (0.6s), 42.867s (0.5s) -- totalling
**1.63 seconds of frozen video**, 3.7% of a 43.8s clip. The CI run reported
``success`` and editorial QA reported ``passed=True``.

The reason is a single line of arithmetic:

```python
# src/editorial_qa.py:178, with max_freeze_duration defaulting to 0.8 at :265
if event["duration"] > max_freeze_duration:
    issues.append(QaIssue("freeze_interval", "error", ...))
```

Each event is individually under 0.8s, so nothing fired. The gate was
**per-event maximum** when the meaningful quantity is a **cumulative total**. A
viewer does not experience three 0.5s holds as three acceptable events; they
experience a two-second stall near the end of the clip, which on a 45-second
hook-driven piece is where retention is already fragile.

So this module reports the sum first, the max second, and the fraction of the
clip third -- and treats an unterminated freeze (one that runs to end-of-file)
as fully disqualifying regardless of duration, because a parser that requires a
closing ``freeze_duration`` reports such a clip as clean.

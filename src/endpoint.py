"""Sentence-boundary resolution for clip endpoints, in one place.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The moment normalizer (``viral_detector._normalize_clip_window``) already cuts
windows at sentence boundaries: a word carrying terminal punctuation, or a
spoken pause of ``GAP_BOUNDARY_S``. The render-time "repair"
(``main._extend_moment_to_complete_transcript``) then re-implemented the same
idea with different rules: it looked at *segment* text instead of word
boundaries, used a hard-coded 54-second ceiling instead of the 55-second
contract, and clamped to that ceiling without checking whether the sentence
actually fit. A production run showed the result: clip #1 was moved off a valid
boundary to exactly ``start + 54.0``, mid-sentence, while the log said
"Extended clip endpoint to complete transcript sentence". The QA layer then
flagged the endpoint as incomplete.

This module is the single source of truth for "is this endpoint a sentence
boundary" and "which boundary should this endpoint move to". The moment
normalizer, the render-time repair and the QA warning all call it.

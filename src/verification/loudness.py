"""Loudness verification.

This is the one part of the pipeline that was already correct, and the point of
this module is to keep it that way. Measured across all six golden masters:

============================  ========  =========
Clip                          LUFS      True peak
============================  ========  =========
clip_1_THE_REAL_FEAR...       -14.1     -1.7 dBFS
clip_2_THE_MYTH_OF...         -14.3     -1.4 dBFS
clip_3_WHY_HARD_WORK          -14.2     -1.5 dBFS
clip_1_HOW_I_MADE_400000      -14.3     -1.5 dBFS
clip_2_WHY_DISNEY_PAY...      -14.4     -1.4 dBFS
clip_1_PAID_OFF_60000...      -14.0     -1.6 dBFS
============================  ========  =========

``loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`` is being honoured to within 0.4 LU and 0.2 dB.
``ARCHITECTURE_AND_METHODOLOGY.md`` section 5 is genuinely implemented, and the
sidechain ducking and SFX chain around it work.

So this module has no defects to catch. It exists as a **regression guard**: the
one number in the whole verification surface that is currently right, and which a
careless change to the audio graph could silently break. A guard that only ever
passes still has value, provided someone has checked that it can fail -- see
``test_grade_severity`` below, and the mutation note on it.

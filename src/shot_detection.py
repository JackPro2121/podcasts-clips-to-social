"""
Shot boundary detection: TransNetV2 (primary) with PySceneDetect (fallback).

`scene_classifier.detect_clip_shots` relies on PySceneDetect's AdaptiveDetector,
which is content-adaptive and therefore *misses hard cuts on low-motion
content* -- precisely the talking-head podcast case this pipeline exists for. A
cut between two similar shots produces almost no pixel delta, so an adaptive
content threshold never fires.

TransNetV2 is a small convolutional network trained specifically for shot
boundaries, so it does not have that blind spot. It is also a genuinely cheap
model (~few MB, 48x27 input), unlike a video LLM.

**The weights are not downloaded.** There is no verified canonical URL for a
TransNetV2 ONNX export, and this project does not invent URLs. Place the file at
`src/models/transnetv2.onnx` (exported from the soCzech/TransNetV2 reference
implementation) and the ONNX path engages automatically. Until then every call
falls through to PySceneDetect and behaviour is byte-identical to before.

The post-processing -- clamping to the requested window, merging sub-minimum
shots -- lives here and is shared by both detectors, so the fallback cannot
drift away from the primary over time.

"""Camera-sway measurement for rendered clips.

The user-visible complaint was shaking: the composed frame oscillated
horizontally and vertically at the motion guarantee's own frequency. Nothing in
the verifier measured it, so both the 107px per-branch drift and the later
15-37px double-oscillator stack shipped.

Method
------
Decode the clip at 15fps, measure the global translation between consecutive
frames with phase correlation, split the trajectory at camera cuts, remove any
linear pan per segment, and read the amplitude of the motion policy's own
frequency band (0.28Hz +/- 0.08). Content-driven movement is broadband and does
not produce a sharp peak in that band, so measuring the band, not total travel,
is what separates policy oscillation from a person leaning.

Thresholds (measured, not guessed)
----------------------------------
Calibrated against the 12-clip golden-master corpus (``tests/fixtures/manifest.json``
carries the human verdicts) plus the artifact of run 37202390593, whose clip #2
was wrongly blocked by the old broadband gate::

    clip                          human      policy   broadband
    high_income_1                 PASS        9.2      16.9   (human note: 35.6px, accepted)
    bathroom_2                    PASS       10.8      22.4   (21.0px note)
    credit_3                      PASS       18.8      18.8   (28.0px note)
    trillion_2                    PASS       13.4      30.5   (37.5px note)
    seven FAIL clips (non-sway)   FAIL      <=10.6    <=33.5
    sixty_k_1                     FAIL       37.1     126.0   (only gross-sway exemplar)
    run 37202390593 clip_2        blocked*   15.0      39.0   (publishable; *old gate)

The old broadband block (32px) sat below content humans accepted and far below
the only gross defect (126px), so publishable clips were lost. The blocks now
sit between the two distributions: broadband 52px keeps ~13px of margin over
the worst accepted content and >2x below the defect; policy 25px already
separates the worst PASS clip (18.8px) from the defect (37.1px). The 39-126px
gap is deliberately unguarded until more runs populate it; warns at 20/38 keep
every occurrence visible in the verdict log.

The metric rejects two transition classes that are not sway, measured on run
37208970507 (which lost 4 of 5 clips to them before this):

* **Directed crop pans.** ``multi_shot_dynamic`` reframes between speakers
  travel 148-350px mostly one way; those segments are skipped
  (``_is_directed_translation``).
* **Short-segment trend residue.** A 2s segment's first FFT bin is 0.5Hz - the
  policy frequency itself - so a single pan or cut reset read as 43-93px of
  "policy sway". A reading now counts only with >= ``MIN_OSCILLATION_CYCLES``.

Still documented, not engineered around: phase correlation reads whatever the
border mask contains; a subject who fills the frame edge contributes their own
motion.

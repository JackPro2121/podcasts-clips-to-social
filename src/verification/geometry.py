"""Frame geometry: pillarboxing, letterboxing, and aspect correctness.

This module exists because of a specific, measured defect. In the published clip
``clip_1_HOW_I_MADE_400000_IN_A_MONTH.mp4`` the two stacked speaker panes were
built at 540x960 -- a 9:16 aspect -- and then scaled into a 1080x960 pane with
``force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease`` followed by an unconditional
``pad=...:color=black``. The result was 270 pixels of pure black on each side:
**50% of the frame width was dead**, and the caption was wider than the live
content strip so it floated over the bars.

Two independent things went wrong, and both had to be fixed for the defect to
disappear:

1. The pane was computed at the wrong aspect. ``PANE_ASPECT = 9/8`` is correct in
   ``face_tracker.py`` but the shipped artifact proves the ratio did not survive
   to the pixels.
2. Nothing noticed. ``blackdetect`` measures whole-frame darkness, so a frame that
   is bright in the middle and black at the edges is *not* a black interval. There
   was no black-bar check anywhere in QA, which is the whole reason the worst
   visual defect in the audit shipped to three social platforms.

So this module measures the *content box* inside the frame directly, which is the
only formulation that catches bars, and reports the **worst** sample rather than
the mean -- a clip that is pillarboxed for 2 of its 45 seconds is a broken clip.

Distinguishing bars from fades
-----------------------------

A raw content box cannot tell a pillarbox from a fade, and the first version of
this module could not. Both shrink the fitted box:

* **Pillarbox** -- the content region is bright and normally exposed; the
  surround is genuine black padding. Bar mean luminance is near zero while the
  content mean is high.
* **Fade** -- there is no padding at all. The whole frame, edges included, has
  been scaled down toward black, so the edges simply fall under the content
  threshold. Bar mean and content mean fall *together*, so their ratio stays
  near 1.

Measured on the corpus, the un-discriminated version reported 4.1% bars on
``clip_2_WHY_DISNEY_PAY_IS_A_TRAP.mp4`` -- which turned out to be a fade-out over
the final 1.2 seconds, not a defect. A verifier that cries wolf is worse than no
verifier, because people learn to ignore it, so :func:`classify_bars` gates on the
bar-to-content luminance ratio and on the content region being bright enough to
have a meaningful surround.

#          published output.
#    4.1%  clip_2_WHY_DISNEY_PAY_IS_A_TRAP.mp4 -- the `blur_stack` layout's
#          blurred background, which is *designed* to be near-black. The blurred
#          coffee-cup pattern measures column max 0-6, so any content-box
#          detector flags it. Not a defect.
#   <2%    codec ringing, fades, and shot transitions.
